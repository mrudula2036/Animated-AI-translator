# Animated-AI-translator

This project is an advanced AI-driven chatbot designed to bridge language barriers through real-time multilingual communication. It supports both voice and text input/output, providing instant translations across multiple languages. The bot uses Natural Language Processing (NLP), Neural Machine Translation (NMT), and Text-to-Speech (TTS) technologies to ensure fluid and human-like conversation.

What makes this bot unique is its integration of animated avatars that visually respond to user inputs with realistic lip-syncing and expressions, offering a more engaging and immersive experience. Ideal for education, customer support, or global collaboration, the bot promotes inclusivity and accessibility by allowing users to communicate in their native language, regardless of the medium.
